like postal service, but instead of packages, information

bits
1 or 0, called binary since only two different states

bandwidth
transmission capacity, measured by bitrate

bitrate
number of bits per second a system can transmit or receive

latency
time it takes for a bit to travel from sender to receiver

how to send data
copper, fiber, wireless

protocol
a well known set of rules and standards used to communicate between machines

internet protocol
ip, and ip address
an address on the internet is just a number that uniqe to each device on the network
like physical postal address
just how there is city, stree, state, country, ip address have sections too
usuallay, region, country, subnet, then device
currently ipv4 (32-bit), allow 4 billion, moving to ipv6 (128-bit) allow 340 undecillion

when devices communicate, also includes 'from' address so know where to respond

domain name system
don't have to know address, associates names with numbers
how dns works, and heigerarcies

not sent via a direct line, but as as packets
can't send large packets, so fragmentent and reassembled at destination

packets have source and destination address
special devices called routers direct paackets based on availabilty to path and congestion

tcp manages the sending and receiving of data as packets, like guarntee mail servie
acknowledges sent packages, and if correct, signs for them all and done
if missing, won't sign and asks for the rest

tcp and routers are scaleable, are fault tolerant and redundant

web browsers accesses webpages for you, using universal resource locator, reference dns
use hyper text transfer protocol, language of servers and browsers, via get requests
pages re displayed in hyper text markup language, made of tag for links, images, titles, etc
get requests are made for each element ie pictures, music

send data to server, (search, input field, blog post) via post request
during loging, browsers get a cookie to identify itself without having to login every time
since cookies can be 'sniffed', us https (secure) via ssl, now tls
when a server replied, it has a signed certificate, verified by a certificate authority, like governments contorl of ids
if sites certificate doesn't check out, browser will give a warning
